    <p class="text-center font-bold pt-4">Welcome to Aeonian Projects</p>

    <p class="pt-2">We are experts in helping businesses, charities and not-for-profits navigate the complex world of GDPR, Data Protection, and privacy. Over the last decade individual privacy and data protection have become key issues for many organisations, with some careless companies receiving fines of millions of pounds.</p>

    <p class="pt-2">At Aeonian Projects we’re passionate about helping you and your organisation meet your statutory obligations with respect to data protection. We have helped organisations both large and small deal with hundreds of Data Breaches and Subject Access Requests, delivered training to hundreds of people, and implemented compliance frameworks to reduce data protection risks – to name but a few of the ways we can help you!
    </p>

    <p class="pt-2">We can provide you with one off support via our Savvy Data Credits or on-going support via Savvy Data Monthly, and we can even act as your ‘in house’ virtual Data Protection Officer.</p>
